Hello! I'm Faraz Malik, a Computer Science student at UofT Scarbrough. My interests include web development, firmware, FOSS and Linux system administration. I'm currently the President of the [UofT WHWC](https://uoftwebloggingclub.neocities.org/), and an active member and website maintainer of [the Byte Babies CTF Team](https://byte-babies.github.io/)
### Example [projects](/projects):

**[UofT Weblogging and Homebrew Website Club](/projects/webloggingclub)**: A handcrafted website and RSS pipeline to highlight various homebrew websites and blogs from the UofT community

**[Simpl.ai](/projects/simplai)**: A webapp that uses Google's Bard to rephrase difficult text. Written for Hack the Valley 7 @ UTSC, winning 2nd place out of ~100.

**[gocomics-api](/projects/gocomics)**: An open source npm package which scrapes gocomics.com for image links. Since being published in 2018, gained 10 stars on Github, ~1000 downloads on npm, and successful pull requests.
