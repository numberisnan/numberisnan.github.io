title: "WHWC March 2025: E-Zines!"
---

Following the [March UofT WHWC Writing Event](https://uoftwebloggingclub.neocities.org/events/march2025) theme of "Smallweb", I'm deciding to dedicate a small part of my site to an interesting smallweb subculture: e-zines!

### What's a Zine?

A cautionary perusal of the relevant [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine) page reveals the it is a typically small-scale and indie distribution of something resembeling a magazine, with strong emphasis on typesetting and graphical elements. For the case of e-zines, there is also the fact that distribution is though the internet, allowing for a more interesting collaboration dynamic. In some cases, this collaboration is psuedonanymous, so artists might not even know each other by name!

I've decided to archive a few of these because of the ethereal nature of these projects, with websites going down and file uploads getting removed, and the occasional nuke-everything-and-run by the admins. Many of these zines are uploaded in the most bizarre places, such as [itch.io](https://itch.io) and [Mega](https://mega.io/), which makes it impossible for the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) to properly archive.

### Archival

The archive is currently around 2GB on my hard drive which might cause issues with Github if I upload it all directly to my website. I'll try to reduce the size somehow and make a page available later containing all the issues for each of these zines.

### Lainzine

This was my first exposure to e-zines. Topics include cyberpunk/hacker culture, but there alot of variety even within this specific space. There's alot of intro-level articles on a variety of computer science and math topics, some creative/political writing, and a suspicious amount of drug procurement guides. I also think these stylistically hit out of the park: I especially love the covers and full-page intermediary pieces.

### Black Fog

This one is more focused on art (with a vague internet/glitch theme), with issues consisting of concatenated comics and visual art collections, from photography to glitch art to drawings. I particularly love the style here too.

### cyberbully

This e-zine has a focus on internet users, but of course gravitates to the smallweb since *that's where all the all the fun happens obviously*. Lots of fun pages, and I especially love the ASCII art full pages and cover.

### Paged Out

This one is a more technical-oriented zine a la [Phrack](https://phrack.org/), but not just raw ASCII which makes the whole thing alot more readable (though more expensive archive). I particularly like the "ICO/PDF polyglot guide" from Issue 1 since this knowledge has somehow come up in a job interview. Theres tons of fun esoteric things like quines and code golfing, even if you arent into cyberecurity, though its a bit inaccessible if you arent familiar with low level programming.

### PoC or GTFO

This zine is typeset in LaTeX which tells alot about the style of articles inside. Similar to Paged Out, there's alot of writeup-style explorations in very deep technical domains. As the name suggests, expanded as "Proof of Concept or Get the Fuck Out", the articles aren't astract in the least: they are things you are able to do *now* on existing computers and setups (which is different from the more abstract kinds of info you learn from textbooks and courses).
