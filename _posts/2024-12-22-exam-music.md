I've noticed I have specific a song stuck in my head for every exam I write, so I'm cataloging it (for fun and profit).

This page will be republished as I write more and more exams!

### Fall 2024 (Finals)

**CSC343 (Intro to Databases) Final**: "Eighth Wonder" - Lemon Demon

**CSCD27 (Computer and Network Security)**: Surprisingly none - I was too focused. *Before* the exam it was "Amnesia Was Her Name" - Lemon Demon.

Overall, somewhat of an obvious pattern. I'm surprised at how many of these songs have animations on Youtube (I think all the lyrical ones from Spirit Phone are covered).

### Winter 2025 (Midterms)

**MGHB02 Miterm**: I was sick, so I was forced to skip this.

**CSCD84 Midterm**: Was too locked in again. As a result I did much better than I expected.

**CSCD43 Midterm**: This time a combination of 2. "Kubrick and the Beast" - Lemon Demon, and "You Imaginary Friend" - Lemon Demon.

I have listened through Dinosaurchestra, View Monster, and Spirit Phone an embarrassing number of times.
