<p class="meta"><small>March 24, 2025</small></p>

<p>Following the <a href="https://uoftwebloggingclub.neocities.org/events/march2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March UofT WHWC Writing Event</a> theme of “Smallweb”, I’m deciding to dedicate a small part of my site to an interesting smallweb subculture: e-zines!</p>

<h3 id="whats-a-zine">What’s a Zine?</h3>

<p>A cautionary perusal of the relevant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a> page reveals the it is a typically small-scale and indie distribution of something resembeling a magazine, with strong emphasis on typesetting and graphical elements. For the case of e-zines, there is also the fact that distribution is though the internet, allowing for a more interesting collaboration dynamic. In some cases, this collaboration is psuedonanymous, so artists might not even know each other by name!</p>

<p>I’ve decided to archive a few of these because of the ethereal nature of these projects, with websites going down and file uploads getting removed, and the occasional nuke-everything-and-run by the admins. Many of these zines are uploaded in the most bizarre places, such as <a href="https://itch.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://mega.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mega</a>, which makes it impossible for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayback Machine</a> to properly archive.</p>

<h3 id="archival">Archival</h3>

<p>The archive is currently around 2GB on my hard drive which might cause issues with Github if I upload it all directly to my website. I’ll try to reduce the size somehow and make a page available later containing all the issues for each of these zines.</p>

<h3 id="lainzine">Lainzine</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ezines/lainszine.png" alt=""></p>

<p><a href="https://lainzine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Website</a></p>

<p>This was my first exposure to e-zines. Topics include cyberpunk/hacker culture, but there alot of variety even within this specific space. There’s alot of intro-level articles on a variety of computer science and math topics, some creative/political writing, and a suspicious amount of drug procurement guides. I also think these stylistically hit out of the park: I especially love the covers and full-page intermediary pieces.</p>

<h3 id="black-fog">Black Fog</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ezines/blackfog.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><a href="https://blackfogzine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Website</a></p>

<p>This one is more focused on art (with a vague internet/glitch theme), with issues consisting of concatenated comics and visual art collections, from photography to glitch art to drawings. I particularly love the style here too.</p>

<h3 id="cyberbully">cyberbully</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ezines/cyberbully.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This e-zine has a focus on internet users, but of course gravitates to the smallweb since <em>that’s where all the all the fun happens obviously</em>. Lots of fun pages, and I especially love the ASCII art full pages and cover.</p>

<h3 id="paged-out">Paged Out</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ezines/pagedout.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This one is a more technical-oriented zine a la <a href="https://phrack.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phrack</a>, but not just raw ASCII which makes the whole thing alot more readable (though more expensive archive). I particularly like the “ICO/PDF polyglot guide” from Issue 1 since this knowledge has somehow come up in a job interview. Theres tons of fun esoteric things like quines and code golfing, even if you arent into cyberecurity, though its a bit inaccessible if you arent familiar with low level programming.</p>

<h3 id="poc-or-gtfo">PoC or GTFO</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ezines/pocorgtfo.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This zine is typeset in LaTeX which tells alot about the style of articles inside. Similar to Paged Out, there’s alot of writeup-style explorations in very deep technical domains. As the name suggests, expanded as “Proof of Concept or Get the Fuck Out”, the articles aren’t astract in the least: they are things you are able to do <em>now</em> on existing computers and setups (which is different from the more abstract kinds of info you learn from textbooks and courses).</p>
